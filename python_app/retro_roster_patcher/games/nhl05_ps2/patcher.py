"""NHL 2005 (PS2) on the unified Patcher interface.

Every write addresses a named TDB record field, never a byte offset: a mistyped
four-character field name is silently ignored by `TDBTable.write_record` and a
wrong record index overwrites a different real player. Neither crashes.

A team slot's records are reached through a four-hop chain, and only the last
hop is a position. For a team slot `t`:

    ROST rows whose TEAM is t  ->  a list of ROST record positions
    ROST[i]["INDX"]            ->  a PLAY record's INDX value
    PLAY[...]["ID__"]          ->  a player id
    SPBT / SPAI / SGAI         ->  the record whose INDX is that player id

Classify a slot as a goalie slot by whether its player id has an SGAI entry, not
by the position in the disc's bio: the attributes need a table with a row for
him.

There is only one mirror, and it is ROST. `DB.VIV` holds `nhl2005.tdb`, the
master, and `nhlrost.tdb`, a second copy of ROST alone. Do not copy
`games/nhl07_psp`'s `_MirrorTables`: this game has no `nhlbioatt.tdb`, so bio and
attribute writes happen once each.

`analyze_rom` and `patch` deliberately do not apply the same checks; do not
harmonise them. See `analyze_rom`.

There is no compressed-image check, unlike `games/nhl07_psp`: a compressed image
handed here is a file with no PVD, which `NHL05PS2RomReader.load` answers with
False.
