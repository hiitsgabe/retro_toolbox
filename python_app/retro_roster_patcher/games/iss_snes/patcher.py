"""International Superstar Soccer (SNES) on the unified Patcher interface.

An explicit slot mapping is required and must stay required: the 27 slots are
national teams -- Germany, Italy, Holland -- and the data source is a club
league, so assigning league team *i* to ROM slot *i* is arbitrary.
`default_slot_mapping` offers that sequential assignment as a starting point
only. There is no `api_key`; do not add one back.

ESPN's squad is today's, its statistics are the season's: `get_squad` has no
season in its URL while `get_player_stats` honours the season in its path, so a
2019 patch gets 2025's names carrying 2019's numbers. The season still reaches
`get_squad` because it is part of the cache key.

`speed` and `stamina` come out of one formula -- see `stat_mapper.py`.

The writer is a ROM hack and `rom_writer.py`'s docstring is the map. Two
consequences reach this module: the order of the write calls in `patch` is load
bearing, and there is no ROM version check anywhere, so a revision other than
the one the ten 65816 patch addresses belong to is patched just as willingly.
