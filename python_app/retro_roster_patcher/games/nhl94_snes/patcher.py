"""NHL 94 (SNES) on the unified Patcher interface.

Roster composition comes out of the ROM: byte 17 of a team block packs the
forward count in its high nibble and the defenceman count in its low nibble, and
goalies are not encoded and are always 2. `map_rosters` is given no ROM, so the
counts travel in two hops -- `analyze_rom` publishes them in
`RomInfo.extra["roster_counts"]`, a caller passes them to
`map_rosters(roster_counts=...)`, and each `NHL94TeamRecord` records the triple
it was cut to. `patch` writes the header from the record, never from the ROM. A
caller that skips the first hop gets `(2, 14, 7)` everywhere.

The pointer table sits at file offset 0xE25E7, in bank $9C -- 927 207 bytes in,
so a file must be ~950 KB before one pointer can be read. `validate` accepts
anything from 649 728 bytes up and tests nothing else, so `patch` checks the
table is addressable (`_pointer_table_fits`) and `analyze_rom` checks the 28
blocks under it parse (`_looks_like_nhl94_snes`).

Nothing here touches a checksum: the SNES does not verify the header word at
$FFDC/$FFDE and NHL '94 does not read it, so an in-place patch of the same length
boots unchanged. The Genesis sibling needs both and does both.
