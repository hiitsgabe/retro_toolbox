"""NHL 07 (PSP) on the unified Patcher interface.

Every write addresses a named TDB record field, never a byte offset: a mistyped
four-character field name is silently ignored by `TDBTable.write_record` and a
wrong record index overwrites a different real player. Neither crashes.

A team slot's records are reached through a four-hop chain, and only the last
hop is a position. For a team slot `t`:

    ROST.find_records("TEAM", t)  ->  a list of ROST record positions
    ROST[i]["INDX"]               ->  a PLAY record's INDX value
    PLAY[...]["ID__"]             ->  a player id
    SPBT / SPAI / SGAI            ->  the record whose INDX is that player id

Classify a slot as a goalie slot by whether its player id has an SGAI entry, not
by the position in the disc's bio: the attributes need a table with a row for
him.

The writes are mirrored across three TDB files. `nhl2007.tdb` is the master and
holds every table; `nhlbioatt.tdb` holds a second copy of SPBT/SPAI/SGAI and
`nhlrost.tdb` a second copy of ROST. Mirror every master write at the same
index, when the mirror has one.

`analyze_rom` and `patch` deliberately do not apply the same checks; do not
harmonise them. See `analyze_rom`.
