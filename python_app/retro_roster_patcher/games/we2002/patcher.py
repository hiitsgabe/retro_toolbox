"""Winning Eleven 2002 (PlayStation) on the unified Patcher interface.

`RomWriter` behaviours this module has to work around:

  * `write_team` writes no players at all unless handed a `players=` list.
  * `write_team` writes only as many players as the slot has room for — 14
    places for slots 0-17, 15 for slots 18-31 — and returns the count it
    actually wrote, so never count `len(record.players)` as patched.
  * `write_team` returns silently for a slot outside 0..31; bound every slot by
    `MAX_ML_SLOTS` before handing it over.
  * `write_team` only queues its 3D-jersey TEX patch; `flush_tex_patches` is
    what applies them, and must be called before the writer goes out of scope.
  * `finalize` returns `None`, so the output file is the only evidence of a
    write.

`verify_patches` is deliberately not called: it returns a human-readable report
and `PatchResult` has nowhere to put one.

The `SlotMapping` in `models.py` is the ROM-facing one and is unused here; only
the JSON-serialisable `core.models` one crosses this interface.
